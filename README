pessheet, a Python extendable spreadsheet

Somtimes a spreadsheet is the best way to work with a calculation. But working 
inside a spreadsheet, sometimes you wish you could create just the function 
you need. pessheet will help you. You have one tab for the spreadsheet, and 
one tab for a python script that defines the functions. 

pessheet can export the spreadsheet as a dot file to be used with graphvis to 
visualize the calculation graph. 

pessheet can also export the spreadsheet as a python script, to be used as a 
starting point to convert the spreadsheet calculation into a program. 

pessheet uses wxPython. 

The logic part is originally based on a comment at

modified.
